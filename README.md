Lưu tạm để tắt gatekeeper 


# Introduction

In recent versions of macOS, Apple has restricted the ability to disable Gatekeeper (the tool that prevents unauthorized apps from running) using the traditional command 
sudo spctl --master-disable

To disable Gatekeeper, a signed configuration file .mobileconfig is now required.
The Disable Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file provides an easy way to turn off Gatekeeper without needing complex steps.

# How to Use the Disable Gatekeeper.mobileconfig File

# Download the Configuration File: 
Ensure you have the Disable Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file ready.

# Install the Configuration File:
Double-click on the Disable Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file to open it in the “Profiles” section of “System Preferences.”
Select "Install" and enter your administrator password if prompted.

# Confirm the Installation:
Once installed, Gatekeeper will be automatically disabled, allowing you to run third-party apps without needing further authentication.

# Re-enable Gatekeeper (If Needed):
  To re-enable Gatekeeper, simply remove the configuration file:
    Go to “System Preferences” > “Profiles.”
    Select the "Disable Gatekeeper" profile and click "Remove."


# Important Note:
Disabling Gatekeeper can lower macOS security; only turn off Gatekeeper when absolutely necessary and re-enable it when you’re finished.

# Warning

Be cautious when disabling Gatekeeper, as it is designed to protect your Mac from potentially unsafe, unauthorized software.
